/* A trio of friends planned to purchase clothing from a particular store for an upcoming party, intending to wear
matching outfits in varying colors - black, blue, and pink. The store had three different clothing sets on display,
each in a different color. The shopkeeper assisted the three friends by selecting a clothing set in the appropriate
color for each person based on their body shape and size. Given a 2D array, price[][3], where price[i][0],
price[i][1], and price[i][2] represent the price of each clothing set for a different colored outfit for person i, your
objective is to determine the minimum cost required to purchase clothing such that each person wears have
different color clothes if they stand in a row.
It should be noted that any two people can wear the same color cloth, but the third person must wear various
color cloths, and all three can wear different colored garments.
Input: N = 3, price[][3] = [{14, 4, 11}, {11, 14, 3}, {14, 2, 10}]
Output: 9
Explanation:
Person 1 chooses blue clothing cost=4. Person 2 chooses pink clothing. Cost = 3. Person 3 chooses blue
clothing. Cost = 2.
As a result, the total cost = 2 + 5 + 3 = 9.
Note: algorithm must take
Time Complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
