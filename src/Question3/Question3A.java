/*
a) Suppose you are provided an array of n targets that are placed in a row from 0 to n-1. Each target is assigned
with certain integer such that a [0] represent the value associated with target zero. You are asked to shoot all
the targets. If you shoot I th target then you will get a[i-1]*a[i]*a[i+1] points.
Note that if i-1 and i+1 position hits index out of bound, then you can assume that two target with value 1 are
padded before start target and after end target.
Return maximum point one can gain by hitting each target.
Input: a = [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167
Explanation:
a = [3,1,5,8]
[3,1,5,8] points 3*1*5 (“hitting target with value 1”)
[3,5,8] points 3*5*8 (“hitting target with value 5”)
[3,8] points 1*3*8 (“hitting target with value 3”) note that there is padded target with value 1 at beginning and end
of the provided target list
,[8] points 1*8*1 same as above
points = 3*1*5+ 3*5*8 + 1*3*8 + 1*8*1 = 167
