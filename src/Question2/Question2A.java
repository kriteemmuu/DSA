a)
Given an integer array nums and another integer k, the goal is to find the longest subsequence of nums that
satisfies the following two conditions:
The subsequence is strictly decreasing.
The difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is at most k.
The output should be the length of the longest subsequence that meets these requirements.
For example, consider the following input:
nums = [8,5,4, 2, 1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 1, 15] k = 3
output=[8,5,4,2,1] or [8,5,4,3,1]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The longest subsequence that meets the requirements is [8,5,4,2,1] or [8,5,4,3,1].
The subsequence has a length of 5, so we return 5.
Note that the subsequence [1,3,4,5,8,15] does not meet the requirements because 15 - 8 = 7 is larger than 3.
